            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Mark. 9.38.</note> and obey his Light in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though we follow not you.</p>
            <p>But if you object and ſay, you have Spiritual Juriſdiction over us, and may juſtlie blame us for ſeparating from you, becauſe that many of us when we were Infants, were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59059:2"/>into your Church, and did enter into Covenant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That then we were not at all capable to know or underſtand the doctrine of your Church, and much leſs of true Faith and Baptiſm, and therefore we could not then enter into any ſuch Covenant as you ſpeak of; but if you ſay, that we did it by our Sureties, who did promiſe and vow in our names: We anſwer, That to no ſuch thing were we then capable of conſenting, therefore you muſt wholly look to the Sureties which your forefathers took; and if they cauſed them to promiſe and vow that which they are in no wiſe able to perform, you may do well to take heed of doing the like to others: And now that we are come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, till we can ſee your Church in the Life and Power of God, and your Doctrine in all things according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we cannot for Conſcience ſake joyn with you.</p>
            <p>Therefore (Friends) in all your Viſitations, Mind the Apoſtles example, who went forth only to viſit thoſe to whom they had preached the Goſpel, that did believe, and were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Jews Synagogues and Heathens Temples;
<note place="margin">Acts 16.36.</note> and do not you ſtretch your ſelves beyond your line, nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly ſeek to be Lords over U S, whom ye have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, nor laboured at all amongſt us; for what have you to do to judge them that are without? Therefore take heed,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.12.</note> leſt the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls (who doubtleſs hath Sheep which are not of your Folds) do judge you as bold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders that would Lord over thoſe of his Heritage,
<note place="margin">John 10.16.</note> which he never committed to your charge. Therefore receive this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from Us,
<note place="margin">Job 31.21, 22.</note> who in humility do reſpect the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and can give double honour to thoſe Over-ſeers that rule well,
<note place="margin">Prov. 28.21.</note> though we cannot give flattering Titles, nor reſpect the perſon of any man; for in ſo doing, our Maker would ſoon take us away.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Come ye to the Light wherewith Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned your Conſciences, that while you ſeek to take the motes out of your brethrens eyes,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.25, 26, 27.</note> you may ſee that there be no beams in your own, which may ſo blind you, that you cannot diſcern Tares from Wheat, nor a Wolf from a Lamb. Therefore firſt begin the work of Reformation in your own
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59059:3"/>hearts and houſholds, till ye be whollie blamleſs as the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of God, &amp;c. according to the Apoſtles Doctrin, 1 Tim. 3. &amp; Tit. 2.7, 8, 9. and be not ye called Lords, becauſe Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, the Princes of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Lordſhip, and their great Ones exerciſe Authority, but it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you:
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3.</note> So in obedience to Chriſt be ye good examples to the Flock, that you and your Miniſters have convinced to your Way, and to all People, that you may have a good report of them that are without; and be not lifted up with pride, leſt ye fall into reproach, and the ſnare of the Divel.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That there may not be a Cry of Oppreſſion in the Countrie, Reform your Officers, Prieſts and Curates, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be everie way blameleſs, as the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet them not up meerlie becauſe they have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts and humane Learning, but try (if you can) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God or no, and whether they have received power from on high by the gift of his Spirit, and be made apt to teach or no, before you ſend them forth; ſee whether there be a neceſſity laid upon them to preach the Goſpel; if ſo, then they will do it freelie, as well in time of perſecution, as in time of proſperitie: And if you would have your Courts eſteemed as Spiritual, then let not your Officers in them be carnal earthlie men, but vertuous, impartial, men fearing God and haring covetouſneſs; and let none of your Prieſts be ſuch as ſay,
<note place="margin">Read Mat. 23.</note> but do not; nor be called of men Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nor have the chiefeſt ſeats in the Aſſemblies, nor go in long Robes, nor lay heavie burdens upon the People, nor devour Widows houſes, nor for a pretence make long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<note place="margin">Iſa 56.10, 11.</note> nor uſe vain repetitions in their Prayers, as the Heathens, chief Prieſts and Phariſees did, which Chriſt cryed woe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; neither let your Prieſts preach for hire, nor your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates divine for money,
<note place="margin">Micha 3.11, 12 Jude.</note> which thing the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wo againſt; neither let them be ſuch as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> called gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-dumb Dogs, which can never have enough, but all look to their own way, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>verie one for his gain from his quarter; neither let them be ſuch as go in the way of Cain, which will envie and perſecute, nor ſuch as go in the way of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>am for rewards, nor ſuch as will ſell chaff for Wheat, which

<note place="margin">Mat. 12.34.</note> for how can they that be evil ſpeak good things?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Reform your people,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that one may diſtinguiſh between your Church and the world: ſeparate the precious from the vile, and withdraw from everie brother that walks diſorderlie; and let not your Church be made numerous with unbelievers,

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59059:4"/>Prieſts and Curates, your People and your Worſhip, till you be both in Word, in Spirit, in Worſhip, &amp; Converſation, one with the Primitive Chriſtians, that men may joyn with you, and not touch an unclean thing; then ſee if we cannot have unity and fellowſhip with you: but in the mean time, let us quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed in our green paſtures, and follow Chriſt the Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls, who leads us to living Fountains of water; and take heed of curſing us whom the Lord hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, leſt it fall upon your own heads; for until you have ſound Doctrine, and the example of a good Converſation, with Chriſtian love and charity, to draw us to a conformity, ye may deſpair of hope to drive us by force and cruelty; for the more of that ye do exerciſe upon us, the more ſhall we be confirmed;

               <l>
                  <hi>Love</hi> far ſurmounts all earthly Diadems,</l>
